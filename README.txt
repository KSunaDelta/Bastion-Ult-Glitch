At the moment you can currently bug out bastion's ult and give it unlim ammo

All you need to do is fire first two shots and on the 3rd shot press Ult and Primary Fire at the same time.

M1, M1, Q+M1 and Spam Fire.

It's easier if you bind Primary fire with the 1 above Q and then press both at same time, whatever works for you.

I made an AHK that does everything for you, just press K and wait until it does it's thing and you can start spamming bombs.
